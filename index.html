                        Mountain Expeditions is a small UK company owned and run by Jon Gupta. We specialise in bespoke,
                        professional
                        and seamlessly-run expeditions around the world.

                        A successful expedition is made up of the hundreds of small wonderful experiences gained from
                        start to
                        finish. We therefore ensure that every aspect of your trip is expertly organised and
                        well-managed.

                        We operate in 6 countries. We respect and value the local communities with whom we work and have
                        nurtured and
                        built strong relationships with them. As a result, we feel we have a deeper understanding of how
                        to best
                        deliver the trip of a lifetime to you.

                <p>
                    From time to time Mountain Expeditions uses a number of carefully and personally selected associate
                    Mountain
                    Leaders (MLs), Mountaineering Instructors (MIA/MICs) and Mountain Guides (UIAGM) to deliver
                    expeditions,
                    instuction and guiding.All of these people are chosen on their individual merits based on the mix of
                    their
                    technical skills, qualifications and excellent interpersonal skills. These guides are both friends
                    as well
                    as colleagues and understand the Mountain Expeditions ethos and deliver to the highest standards.

                <h2>Our Leaders</h2>
                <p>
                    On every expedition, the number of participants is kept to a level to enable the highest quality to
                    be
                    maintained. We do not want to be that company where you become a number or even a blur after the
                    expedition has finished, so we have a strict cut off point to ensure that our groups never become
                    too
                    big.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We strongly believe that by doing this our Mountain Expeditions Leaders are able to provide a more
                    personalised service and we find that group dynamics work much better than when travelling in high
                    numbers. Therefore, your success rate and enjoyment increases immeasurably.
